Quality Rules:

1. Be as concise as possible. (Aim for 30 words or less in a node, 40 if its the archeologist)
2. Focus on the characters not the lore. Dialogue should reflect how they would be feeling/behaving in their situations. 
3. DO NOT force lore into a line it is not needed in. 
4. Don't give away NPC intentions for no reason. 
5. Most people wont remember what is said so don't get stuck on one liners and single thoughts. 

Character Rules:

1. The immortal's dialogue should always say "Old Man" and not "Immortal"
