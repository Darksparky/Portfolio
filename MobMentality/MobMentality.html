            <h1>About This Game</h1>
            <p>
                Created as a school project by Chris Clarke, Jamie Hopkins, Thomas Meharey and Thomas Vanderwyst, Mob Mentality is set in a medieval world where the player takes on the role of angry mob of villager who must recruit more villagers to join the fight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Win by slaying the monster, draining his health to zero. Lose by allowing the monster to dwindle your total population to less than half. Gather a large enough force by first selecting a starting villager. Then walk amongst the other villagers using the Rally ability to add them to your cause. Finally approach the monster close enough for your mob to strike but not so close as to be wiped out yourself!
            </p>
            
            <p> Many of the assets used in this game were purchased on the unity store. </p>
            
            <h1>My Contributions</h1>
            <p>
                Our prompt for this project was to try and make a game with a "squishy" game feel. This was something I don't think we quite got right, but I learned a lot from it regardless. My contribuitions to the game included: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creating the initial layout of the level, doing the first pass on the creation of the level, but no subsequent work on the level design afterwards.   
                </li>
                <li>

                        My largest contribution was programming the main movement mechanics. The goal for this was to try and make the player feel like they are controlling a squishy mob of villagers(as opposed to being in control of any singular villager). To that end, I researched ai flocking(boids) behaviours and attempted to apply what I could to a group that the player has direct control over. 

                        I took advantage of the built-in NavMesh funtionality to handle avoidence and cohesion behaviours, and I made adjustments to steering behavious to work with manual control over the group. It functions by having the system organised into Units and Groups.
                    
                        Each group has a leader and a hidden leader. The player only has direct control, abstracted through unity's NavMesh system, over the hidden leader. The hidden leader is an invisible object with no hitbox that the player can move around by giving it directions to move in, then it will raycast to find the closest appropriate point on the navmesh. This abstraction is done to insure that the player's hidden control point stays in walkable areas. A script then feeds commands to the units in the group, based on the invisible object the player is controlling. The visual leader is then given priority with respect to moving to the space that the hidden leader occupies in order to stableize the group, so the units are not constantly swapping places inside the group unnaturally. 
                    
                        I made it so that groups could be formed, undone, and combined dynamically. There are a bunch of other small things going on for the main movement mechanics, but this generally covers how it is handled behind the scenes.
 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also programmed the game's camera movement, which was made a lot easier by using Unity's Cinemachine. It is done in such a way that it switches from being freely controlled while not in control of units, to following the group while trying to keep the whole mob in frame(within reason). 
                </li>
                
            </ul>
